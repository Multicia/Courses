	<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
	Demand paging is a method of mapping a large address space into a
	relatively small amount of physical memory. This is accomplished by
	using a "backing store" (usually disk) to hold pages of memory not
	currently needed. Paging is what allows us to use more address space
	than is physically available, and to run programs in non-contiguous
	sections of memory.
	<p>From this point on only the details of this project are
		discussed. It is assumed that you have read the Intel documents and
		are comfortable with paging concepts and the Intel specific details.

	<h2>2 Goals</h2>
	The ultimate goal of this project is to provide the facilities to
	implement the system calls listed below.
	<h2>3 Implementation</h2>

	<h3>3.1 System Calls</h3>
	<b>SYSCALL xmmap (int virtpage, bsd_t source, int npages)</b>
	<p>Much like its Unix counterpart (see man mmap) it will map a
		source "file" ("backing store" here) of size npages pages to the
		virtual page virtpage. A process may call this multiple times to map
		data structures, code, etc.
	<p>
		<b>SYSCALL xmunmap (int virtpage)</b>
	<p>This call, like munmap, should remove a virtual memory mapping.
		See man munmap for the details of the Unix call.
	<p>
		<a NAME="vcreate"><b>SYSCALL</a> vcreate (int *procaddr, int
		ssize, <font color="#000066">int hsize</font>, int priority, char
		*name, int nargs, long args)</b>
	<p>
		This call will create a new Xinu process. The difference from create()
		is that the process's heap will be private and exist in its virtual
		memory. <br>The size of the heap (in number of pages)&nbsp; is
		specified by the user.
	<p>create() should be left (mostly) unmodified. Processes created
		with create should not have a private heap but should still be able to
		use xmmap().
	<p>
		<b>WORD *vgetmem (int nbytes)</b>
	<p>Much like getmem(), vgetmem() will allocate the desired amount
		of memory if possible. The difference is that vgetmem() will get the
		memory from a process' private heap located in virtual memory. A call
		to getmem() will continue to allocate memory from the regular Xinu
		kernel heap.
	<h3>
		<b><font size=+0>SYSCALL&nbsp; srpolicy (int policy)</font></b>
	</h3>
	<font size=+0>This function will be used to set the page
		replacement policy to Second-chance (SC) or Not Recently Used (NRU). You can declare constant SC as
		3 and NRU as 4 for this purpose.</font>
	<p>
		<b><font size=+0>SYSCALL vfreemem (block_ptr, int
				size_in_bytes)</font></b>
	<p>
		<font size=+0>You will implement a corresponding vfreemem()
			call for the vgetmem(bytes) call. It will take two parameters and
			will return OK or SYSERR. The two parameters are similar to those of
			the freemem() call in the original Xinu. The type of the first
			argument <i>block_ptr </i>will depend on your own implementation.
		</font>
	<h2>4 Overall Organization</h2>
	The following sections discuss at a high level the organization of the
	system, the various pieces we need to implement demand paging in Xinu
	and how they relate to each other. This handout describes ideas for
	implementation in Xinu. You are welcome to use a different
	implementation strategy if you think it is easier or better as long as
	it has the same functionality and challenges.
	<h3>4.1 Memory and Backing Store</h3>

	<h4>4.1.1 Backing Stores</h4>
	Virtual memory commonly uses disk space to extend the memory of the
	machine. However, we must remember that our version of Xinu has no file
	system support. Also, we cannot use the network to communicate with a
	page server which will manage the backing stores. Instead, we will
	emulate the backing store (how it is emulated will be detailed in
	4.1.3). To access the backing store you are given the following (These
	calls are in the directory
	<i>paging</i>. ):
	<ol>
		<li><b>bsd_t</b> The backing store descriptor type is used to
			reference a backing store. The type declaration for it is in
			paging.h. This type is merely unsigned int.</li>

		<p>There are 16 backing stores. You will use the IDs zero through fifteen to identify them.
		<li><b>int get_bs (bsd_t store, unsigned int npages)</b> This
			call requests from the page server a new backing store with id store
			of size npages (in pages, not bytes). If the page server is able to
			create the new backingstore, or a backingstore with this ID already
			exists, the size of the new or existing backingstore is returned.
			This size is in pages. If a size of 0 is requested, or the pageserver
			encounters an error, SYSERR is returned.</li>

		<p>Also for practical reasons, the npages will be no more than
			128.
		<li><b>int release_bs (bsd_t store)</b> This call requests that
			the page server release the backing store with ID store.</li>
		<p>
		<li><b>SYSCALL read_bs (char *dst, bsd_t store, int page)</b>
			This copies <i>page</i>th page from the backing store referenced by
			store to dst. It returns OK on success, SYSERR otherwise. The first
			page of a backing store is page zero.</li>
		<p>
		<li><b>SYSCALL write_bs (char *src, bsd_t store, int page)</b>
			This copies a page pointed to by src to the <i>page</i>th page of the
			backing store referenced by store. It returns OK on success, SYSERR
			otherwise.</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>4.1.2 Memory Layout</h4>
	The basic Xinu memory layout will be as follows:
	<center>
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Virtual memory
		<p>(pages 4096 and beyond)
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>3072 frames
		<p>
			(pages 1024 - 4095) <br>&nbsp;
		<p>---------------------------------
		<p>Kernel Memory (pages 406 - 1023)
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Kernel Memory(pages 160 -
			405)
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Kernel Memory (pages 25 -
			159) <br>&nbsp;
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Xinu text, data, bss
			(pages 0 - 24) <br>----------------------------------
	</center>

	<p>As you can see our Xinu version will compile
		to about 100k, or 25 pages. The PC has an area of memory from page 160
		through the end of page 405 that cannot be used (this is referred to
		as the "HOLE" in initialize.c). We will place the free frames into
		pages 1024 through 4095, giving 3072 frames.
	<p>The frames will be used to store resident pages, page
		directories, and page tables. The remaining free memory below page
		4096 is used for Xinu's kernel heap (organized as a freelist).
		getmem() and getstk() will obtain memory from this area (from the
		bottom and top respectively).
	<p>All memory below page 4096 will be "global". That is, it is
		usable and visible by all processes and accessible by simply using its
		actual physical addresses. As a result, the first four page tables for
		every process will be the same, and thus should be shared.
	<p>Memory at page 4096 and above constitute a process' virtual
		memory. This address space is private and visible only to the process
		which owns it. Note that the process' private heap and (optionally)
		stack are located somewhere in this area.
	<h4>4.1.3 Backing Store Emulation</h4>
	Since our version of Xinu does not have file system and network
	support, we need to emulate the backing store with physical memory. In
	particular, consider the following Xinu memory layout:
	<center>
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Virtual Memory
		<p>(pages 4096 and beyond)
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>16 Backing stores
		<p>(pages 2048 - 4095)
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>1024 frames
		<p>(pages 1024 - 2047)
		<p>---------------------------------
		<p>Kernel Memory (pages 406 - 1023)
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Kernel Memory (pages 160 -
			405)
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Kernel Memory (pages 25 -
			159) <br>&nbsp;
		<p>
			--------------------------------- <br>Xinu text, data, bss
			(pages 0 - 24) <br>----------------------------------
	</center>

	Each backend machine has 16 MB (4096 pages) of real memory. And we
	reserve the top 8MB real memory as backing stores. We have 16 backing stores and each backing
	store will only map maximum 128 pages (each page is 4K size). As a
	result, we have the following map between the backing store and the
	corresponding physical memory range:

	<center>
		<p>backing store 0: 0x00800000 - 0x0087ffff
		<p>backing store 1: 0x00880000 - 0x008fffff
		<p>backing store 2: 0x00900000 - 0x0097ffff
		<p>backing store 3: 0x00980000 - 0x009fffff
		<p>backing store 4: 0x00a00000 - 0x00a7ffff
		<p>backing store 5: 0x00a80000 - 0x00afffff
		<p>backing store 6: 0x00b00000 - 0x00b7ffff
		<p>backing store 7: 0x00b80000 - 0x00bfffff
		<p>backing store 8: 0x00c00000 - 0x00c7ffff
		<p>backing store 9: 0x00c80000 - 0x00cfffff
		<p>backing store 10: 0x00d00000 - 0x00d7ffff
		<p>backing store 11: 0x00d80000 - 0x00dfffff
		<p>backing store 12: 0x00e00000 - 0x00e7ffff
		<p>backing store 13: 0x00e80000 - 0x00efffff
		<p>backing store 14: 0x00f00000 - 0x00f7ffff
		<p>backing store 15: 0x00f80000 - 0x00ffffff
	</center>

	In the implementation, you need to "steal" physical memory frames 2048
	- 4095 (take a close look at sys/i386.c, and pay attention to the
	variables
	<i>npages</i> and
	<i>maxaddr</i>). As a result, this portion of memory will not be used
	for other purposes. You can assume that our grading program will not
	modify this part of memory.

	<h4>4.1.4 Page Tables and Page Directories</h4>
	As stated before page tables and page directories (i.e. outer page
	tables) can be placed in any free frame. For this project you will not
	be paging either the page tables or page directories. Because page
	tables are always resident it is not practical to allocate all
	potential page tables for a process when it is created (you will,
	however, allocate a page directory). To map all 4 GB of memory would
	require 4 MB of page tables! To conserve memory, page tables must be
	created on-demand. That is, the first time a page is legally touched
	(i.e. it has been mapped by the process) for which no page table is
	present a page table should be allocated. Conversely, when a page table
	is no longer needed it should be removed to conserve space.
	<h3>4.2 Support Data Structures</h3>

	<h4>4.2.1 Finding the Backingstore for a Virtual Address</h4>
	You may realize that there is a problem- If a process can map multiple
	address ranges to different backing stores, how does one figure out
	which backing store a page needs to be read from (or written to) when
	it is being brought into (removed from) a frame?
	<p>To accomplish this you need to keep track of which backing store
		the process was allocated when it was created using vcreate. Finding
		the offset (i.e the particular page within the store to write/read
		from) can be calculated using the virtual page number. You may need to
		declare a new kernel data structure which maps virtual address spaces
		to backing store descriptors. We will call this the backing store map.
		It should be a tuple like:
	<center>
		<p>
			<b>{ pid, vpage, npages, store }</b>
	</center>

	<p>You should write a function that performs the lookup:
	<center>
		<p>
			<b>f (pid , vaddr)= > {store, pageoffset within store}</b>
	</center>

	<p>The function xmmap() will add a mapping to this table. xmunmap()
		will remove a mapping from this table.
	<h4>4.2.2 Inverted Page Table</h4>
	When writing out a dirty page you may have noticed the only way to
	figure out which virtual page and process (and thus which backing
	store) a dirty frame belongs to would be to traverse the page tables of
	every process looking for a frame location that corresponds to the
	frame we wish to write out. This is highly inefficient. To prevent
	this, we use another kernel data structure, an inverted page table. The
	inverted page table contains tuples like:
	<center>
		<p>
			<b>{ framenumber, pid, virtual pagenumber }</b>
	</center>

	<p>Of course, if we use an array of size NFRAMES the frame number
		is implicit and just the index into the array. With this structure we
		can easily find the pid and virtual page number of the page held
		within any frame i. From that we can easily find the backing store
		(using the backing store map) and compute which page within the
		backing store corresponds with the page in frame i.
	<p>You may also want to use this table to hold other information
		for page replacement (i.e., any data
		needed to estimate page replacement policy).
	<h3>4.3 Process Considerations</h3>
	With each process having its own page directory page tables there are
	some new considerations in dealing with processes.
	<h4>4.3.1 Process Creation</h4>
	When a process is created we must now also create page directory and
	record the address. Also remember that the first 16 megabytes of each
	process will be mapped to the 16 megabytes of physical memory, so we
	must initialize the process' page directory accordingly. This is
	important as our backing stores also depend on this correct mapping.

	<p>
		A mapping must be created for the new process' private heap and stack
		, if created with <b>vcreate()</b>. Because you are limited to 16
		backing stores you may want to use just one mapping for both the heap
		and the stack (as with the kernel heap), <b>vgetmem()</b> taking from
		one end and the stack growing from the other. (Keeping a private stack
		and paging it is optional. But a private heap must be maintained).
	<h4>4.3.2 Process Destruction</h4>
	When a process dies the following should happen.
	<ol>
		<li>All frames which currently hold any of its pages should be
			written to the backing store and be freed.</li>

		<li>All of it's mappings should be removed from the backing store
			map.</li>

		<li>The backing stores for its heap (and stack if have chosen to
			implement a private stack) should be released (remember backing
			stores allocated by a process should persist unless the process
			explicitly releases them).</li>

		<li>The frame used for the process' page directory should be
			released.</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>4.3.3 Context Switching</h4>
	It should also be clear that now as we switch between processes we must
	also switch between memory spaces. This is accomplished by adjusting
	the PDBR register with every context switch. We must be careful,
	however, as this register must always point to a valid page directory
	which is in RAM at a page boundary.
	<p>Think carefully about where you place this switch if you put it
		in resched()- before or after the actual context switch.
	<h4>4.3.4 System Initialization</h4>
	The NULL process is somewhat of a special case, as it builds itself in
	the function sysinit(). The NULL process should not have a private
	heap(like any process created with create()).
	<p>The following should occur at system initialization:
	<ol>
		<li>Set the DS and SS segments' limits to their highest values.
			This will allow processes to use memory up to the 4 GB limit without
			generating general protection faults. Make sure the initial stack
			pointer (initsp) is set to a real physical address (the highest
			physical address) as it is in normal Xinu. See i386.c. And don't
			forget to "steal" physical memory frames 2048 - 4096 for backing
			store purposes.</li>

		<li>Initialize all necessary data structures.</li>

		<li>Create the page tables which will map pages 0 through 4095 to
			the physical 16 MB. These will be called the global page tables.</li>

		<li>Allocate and initialize a page directory for the NULL
			process.</li>

		<li>Set the PDBR register to the page directory for the NULL
			process.</li>

		<li>Install the page fault interrupt service routine.</li>

		<li>Enable paging.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>4.4 The Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)</h3>
	As you know, a page fault triggers an interrupt 14. When an interrupt
	occurs the machine pushes CS:IP and then an error code (see Intel
	Volume III chapter 5)
	<center>
		<p>
			---------- <br>error code <br>---------- <br>IP <br>----------
			<br>CS <br>---------- <br>... <br>...
	</center>

	<p>It then jumps to a predetermined point, the ISR . To specify the
		ISR we use the routine:
	<p>
		<b>set_evec(int interrupt, (void (*isr)(void)))</b>   (see sys/evec.c)
	<p>
	<h3>4.5 Faults and Replacement Policies</h3>

	<h4>4.5.1 Page Faults</h4>
	A page fault indicates one of two things: the virtual page on which the
	faulted address exists is not present or the page table which contains
	the entry for the page on which the faulted address exists is not
	present. To deal with a page fault you must do the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Get the faulted address a.</li>

		<li>Let vp be the virtual page number of the page containing of
			the faulted address.</li>

		<li>Let pd point to the current page directory.</li>

		<li>Check that a is a legal address (i.e. that it has been
			mapped). If it is not, print an error message and kill the process.</li>

		<li>Let p be the upper ten bits of a. [What does p represent?]</li>

		<li>Let q be the bits [21:12] of a. [What does q represent?]</li>

		<li>Let pt point to the pth page table. If the pth page table
			does not exist obtain a frame for it and initialize it.</li>

		<li>To page in the faulted page do the following:</li>

		<ol>
			<li>Using the backing store map, find the store s and page
				offset o which correspond to vp.</li>

			<li>In the inverted page table increment the reference count of
				the frame which holds pt. This indicates that one more of pt's
				entries is marked "present."</li>

			<li>Obtain a free frame, f .</li>

			<li>Copy the page o of store s to f .</li>

			<li>Update pt to mark the appropriate entry as present and set
				any other fields. Also set the address portion within the entry to
				point to frame f .</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>

	<h4>4.5.2 Obtaining a Free Frame</h4>
	When a free frame is needed it may be necessary to remove a resident
	page from frame. How you pick the page to remove depends on your page
	replacement policy,
	<p>Your function to find a free page should do the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Search inverted page table for an empty frame. If one exists
			stop.</li>

		<li>Else, Pick a page to replace.</li>

		<li>Using the inverted page table, get vp, the virtual page
			number of the page to be replaced.</li>

		<li>Let a be vp*4096 (the first virtual address on page vp).</li>

		<li>Let p be the high 10 bits of a. Let q be bits [21:12] of a.</li>

		<li>Let pid be the pid of the process owning vp.</li>

		<li>Let pd point to the page directory of process pid.</li>

		<li>Let pt point to the pid's pth page table.</li>

		<li>Mark the appropriate entry of pt as not present.</li>

		<li>If the page being removed belongs to the current process ,
			invalidate the TLB entry for the page vp using the invlpg instruction
			(see Intel Volume III/II).</li>

		<li>In the inverted page table decrement the reference count of
			the frame occupied by pt. If the reference count has reached zero,
			you should mark the appropriate entry in pd as being not present.
			This conserves frames by keeping only page tables which are
			necessary.</li>

		<li>If the dirty bit for page vp was set in its page table you
			must do the following:</li>

		<ol>
			<li>Using the backing store map find the store and page offset
				within store given pid and a. If the lookup fails, something is
				wrong. Print an error message and kill the process pid.</li>

			<li>Write the page back to the backing store.</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>

	<h4>4.5.3 Page Replacement Policies</h4>
	You must implement two page replacement algorithms: SC and NRU.

	<p>For SC, when a frame is allocated for a page, you insert the frame into a circular queue. 
        When a page replacement occurs, SC first looks at the current position in the queue (current position starts from the head of the queue), checks to see whether its reference bit is set (i.e., pt_acc = 1). If it is not set, the page is swapped out. Otherwise, the reference bit is cleared, the current position moves to the next page and this process is repeated. If all the pages have their reference bits set, on the second encounter, the page will be swapped out, as it now has its reference bit cleared. </p>

	<p>For NRU, when a page replacement occurs, you first examine reference bit (e.g., pt_acc) and modification bit (e.g., pt_dirty) to classify the page in one of 4 following classifications: 
<ol>
<li> Class 0: pt_acc = 0, pt_dirty = 0
<li> Class 1: pt_acc = 0, pt_dirty = 1
<li> Class 2: pt_acc = 1, pt_dirty = 0
<li> Class 3: pt_acc = 1, pt_dirty = 1
</ol>
Then a page at the lowest nonempty class will be replaced first. If more than one page at the lowest nonempty class, the oldest page will be used for replacement. Note that, at a certain fixed time interval (2 seconds), all the reference bits of all pages must be cleared, so only pages referenced within the current interval are marked with a reference bit of 1. Please check out sys/clkint.S to get some idea of how you should implement this reference bit clearing routine.<br>
<br>
	Default page replacement policy should be SC; srpolicy(NRU) will be called in main() to switch the replacement policy from SC to NRU. <span
			style="color: red;">When replacements occur, ONLY replaced frame
		numbers (not addresses) MUST be printed out for grading.</span></p>

	<p>Note that you are free to add whatever structures you'd like in
		your inverted page table.</p>

	<h2>5 Required API Calls</h2>
	You must implement the system calls listed in the beginning of this
	handout exactly as specified. Be sure to check the parameters for
	validity. For example, no process should be allowed to remap the lowest
	16 MB of the system (global memory).
	<p>None of Xinu's other system calls interfaces should be modified.








	
	<h2>6&nbsp;Details on the Intel Architecture and Xinu</h2>
	After having read chapters two and three in
	<font color="#000000"> <a
		href="http://www.intel.com/design/pentiumii/manuals/243192.htm">
			volume 3</a></font> you should have a basic understanding of the details of
	memory management in the Intel architecture.
	<p>The following might be useful for you to know:
	<ol>
		<li>We are using the Intel Pentium chip, not the Pentium Pro or
			Pentium II. Some details of those chips do not apply.</li>

		<li>Xinu uses the flat memory model, i.e. physical address =
			linear addresses.</li>

		<li>The segments are set in i386.c in the function setsegs().</li>

		<li>Pages are 4k (4096 bytes) in size. Do not use 2M or 4M page
			size</li>

		<li>The backend machines have 16 MB (4096 pages) of real memory.</li>

		<li>Some example code is given in the project directory for
			getting and setting the control registers. A useful function,
			dump32(unsigned long), for dumping a binary number with labeled bits
			is also given.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>7 Given Code</h2>
	In this lab, we will use another version of xinu that can be downloaded
	in the following link:
	<a
		href="lab3-spring14.tgz">(lab3-spring14.tgz)</a>
	This version of Xinu contains the skeleton code for the backing store
	calls. It also has .h files needed for this project. Test file:<br>
	<a href="testmain.c">testmain.c</a>.<br>
	<a href="test_policy.c">test_policy.c</a>. Output template: <a href="test_policy.out">test_policy.out</a>.
	<h2>8 Debugging</h2>
	Please try to debug by yourself first. Also realize that you know your
	program best.
	<p>
		Furthermore, if it helps you, you can uncomment the #define's in
		evec.c to get a stack trace and register dump. Using this and nm on
		the file xinu.elf can help you locate where your program crashed. Or
		you may recompile everything using the compiler's -g flag, disassemble
		xinu.elf using <i>objdump -d xinu.elf > xinu.dis</i>, load xinu.dis
		into your text editor and search for the return address in the stack.
		In the disassembly the addresses are the numbers on the left (e.g.
		ab3e:). This will show you the function name (may be some lines above)
		of the function the crash occurred in and (if you compiled that
		particular file with -g) the C line number in the []'s.
	<p>The most difficult problem to diagnose is when the machine
		simply reboots itself. This is usually the result of having a bad
		stack pointer. In such a case the machine cannot give a trap.
	<h2>9 What to Turn In</h2>

	The goal of this assignment is to provide support for :
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Memory mapping: mapping of the first 16 Mb of physical
			memory, and the xmmap() and xmunmap() system calls</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Different running processes created with <i>vcreate</i> can
				have its own private heap
			</li>
			<li>vgetmem, vfreemem: implemented and fully functional</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>All running processes can simply share the same page table</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Demand paging: data is retrieved from the backing stores only
			when needed</li>
		<li>Backing store management:
			<ul>
				<li>get_bs, release_bs, read_bs, write_bs: implemented and
					fully functional</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Page replacement: SC, NRU</li>
	</ul>

	</ul>

	Remember that, per the specification, page tables are created and
	destructed on demand. In other words, you system must not pre-allocate
	page tables. Also, page tables that do not contain at least on valid
	entry pointing to a data page should be destroyed (the frame should be
	freed) as soon as their last entry is invalidated. Page tables and page
	directories are not paged out.

	</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i) copy the entire
		csc501-lab3 directory to csc501-lab3, go to the csc501-lab3/compile
		directory and do "make clean".</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) go to the
		directory of which your csc501-lab3 directory is a subdirectory (NOTE:
		please do not rename csc501-lab3, or any of its subdirectories.)</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		e.g., if /home/csc501/csc501-lab3 is your directory structure, goto
		/homes/csc501</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii) create a
		subdirectory TMP (under the directory csc501-lab3) and copy all the
		files you have modified/written, both .c files and .h files into the
		directory.</p>

	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv) compress the
		csc501-lab3 directory into a tgz file and use Wolfware's <b>Submit
			Assignments</b> facility. Please only upload one tgz file.
	</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		tar czf csc501-lab3.tgz csc501-lab3</p>


	<h2>10 A Last Note</h2>
	Even with the design given to you this is not necessarily an easy
	project. Dealing with low level aspects of the machine is always
	difficult. Please do not procrastinate. It is very easy (especially
	with Xinu and even more so when working at a low level) to run into
	problems.
	<br>&nbsp;
	<p>
		<b><font color="#330033"><font size=+2>FAQs:</font></font></b>
	<p>
		<b>1) In the specification of the vcreate() system call, the
			parameter <i><a href="#vcreate">hsize</a></i> refers to the heap size
			as number of pages (not number of bytes).
		</b> <br>&nbsp;
	<p>
		<b>2) How do I get the virtual page number from a virtual address?</b>
	<p>
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The most significant 20 bits of a virtual
		address form the virtual page number.
	<p>
		<b>3) About the mapping &lt; pid, vpage, npages, store ></b>
	<p>
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>This mapping is maintained inside the
		kernel. Since the "store"&nbsp; can take only 16 values at the most
		(because there are only 16 backing stores possible for any user), and
		for each process, no store can be mapped to more than one range of virtual memory at any
		time, the table that stores these mappings will contain only at most 16
		entries for each process. 

                <!--This table is placed in kernel data segment in the first 25
		pages of the physical memory. You need not take any extra care about
		placing this table. Just create an array of 16 entries of the type of
		the mapping and that's all. It is pretty similar to semaph[] and
		proctab[].-->
	<p>
		<b>4) srpolicy()</b>
	<p>
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>This system call will not be called at
		arbitrary places inside your code to force changing from one
		replacement policy to another. You can assume that the default policy
		is SC and srpolicy(NRU), if called, will be the
		first statement in the program. So, need not worry about switching
		from one replacement policy to another midway through the execution.
	<p>
		<b>5) Paging.h contains two structures pd_t and pt_t which
			contains a lot of bit fields. Initially which fields should be set in
			a page directory and a page table?</b>
	<p>
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>For page directories, set the following bits
		and make the other bits zero : pd_write always and pd_pres whenever
		the corresponding page tables are present in the main memory.
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the four global page tables, set the
		following bits: pt_pres and pt_write. You can make others zero.
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (This answer should be fairly obvious if you
		have read the Intel manuals carefully. But, they are mentioned just in
		case and don't read too much into this answer and confuse yourself).
	<p>
		<b>6) Where do we place the page tables and page directories?</b>
	<p>
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The page tables and page directories are to
		be placed in the following memory range: If your memory is divided
		into 4096 pages, then they should be placed in the range 1024-1535.
		They should be placed on page boundaries only, i.e., the starting
		address of any page table or page directory should be divisible by the
		size of the pages NBPG.
	<p>
		<b><font size=+1>*** 7) What is the use of xmmap()?</font></b>
	<p>
		<b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></b>There was a big
		misconception about the usage of xmmap() among many students. When
		does a user process call xmmap()?. Why is it used for?.
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though, xmmap() is given in the first
		page of your handout, it is not the most important system call that
		you should implement. Also, it is not main part of the project. Also,
		it is not the only way by which you can access virtual memory and test
		your implementation.
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, how else can a process try to use virtual
		memory? Here is one<b> example</b>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main() <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		vcreate(process A, , , hsize = 100,
		,,,);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* process A is
		created with a virtual heap of 100 pages */
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
	<p>/* This virtual heap will be present in a backing store that is
		exclusive for this process alone. (No backing store will be shared
		across processes. Neither will the same backing store be mapped to
		multiple memory ranges.) */
	<p>/* This virtual heap present in a backing store will be mapped
		from in the address ranges 4096th page to 4196th page of this process.
		So, the backing store mapping table you maintain will contain an entry
		&lt; process B's pid, 4096, 100, backing store number > */
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process A() <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		int *x; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		int temp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		x = vgetmem(1000);&nbsp; /* allocates some memory in the virtual heap
		which is in virtual memory */ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		/* the following&nbsp; statement will cause a page fault. The page
		fault handling routing&nbsp; will read in the required page from
		backing store into the main memory, set the proper page tables and the
		page directory entries and reexecute the statement. */ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		*x = 100; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		x++; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		*x = 200; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		temp = *x;&nbsp; /* You are reading back from virtual heap to check if
		the previous write was successful */
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		vfreemem(--x, 1000); /* frees the allocation in the virtual heap */ <br>}








	
	<p>In the previous example, you accessed virtual memory, found that
		the access creates a page fault and&nbsp; will handle the page
		fault.&nbsp; This example some fair idea about how to use your virtual
		memory and how to test your implementation of virtual memory.
	<p>Then, why do we need xmmap() and what does it do? Xmmap() is
		very similar to mmap() of Unix. It treats the backing stores as
		"files". One potential usage of xmmap() is as follows:
	<p>
		Process A: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		char *x; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		char temp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		get_bs(4, 100); <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		xmmap(7000, 4, 100);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* This call simply creates an
		entry in the backing store mapping */ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		x = 7000*4096; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		*x =
		'Y';&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		/* write into virtual memory, will create a fault and system should
		proceed as in the prev example */ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		temp =
		*x;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		/* read back and check */ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		xmunmap(...);
	<p>/* This can be thought of as you creating a file, whose name is
		"4". It is a big empty file of size 100 pages. You store a character
		'A' as the first character in the file. But, instead of using file I/O
		operations, since you have mapped the file to a memory location, you
		modify the file by means of a memory modification !! */
	<p>Let us say there is another process B which executes the
		following code after a while the prev code was executed (assume that
		'A' has not executed xmunmap(...))
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Process B:
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		char *x; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		char temp_b; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                get_bs(4, 100); <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		xmmap(6000, 4, 100); <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		x = 6000 * 4096; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		temp_b = *x:&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Surprise: Now, temp_b will get the value
		'Y' written by the process A to this backing store '4' */
	<p>
		These examples should make the usage of xmmap() more clear. Think
		about it. <br>&nbsp;
	<p>
		<b>8) Page fault handling routine (page fault ISR) - What should
			be done here?</b>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psuedo code for the implementation (which would be easier if you do it in assembly)
	<p>
	    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) store error code in a global variable<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) store flag register<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) clear all interrupts<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) save all general registers<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) page fault handling<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) restore general registers<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) restore flag register<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) iret<br>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have not written in assembly language
		before, look at some code written in assembly in xinu itself. Or else,
		disassemble some simple C code and check the assembly code. Note that not
		everything has to be implemented in assembly as it would be very difficult.
		Thus, you could include a call to a C function which handles 5).
	<p>
		<b>9) Are read_bs and write_bs blocking calls and can they be used
			inside our interrupt handling routine?</b>
	<p>
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>They are, and can be
		used inside the page fault handling routine. 
	<p>
		<b>10) A request/directive</b>
	<p>
		<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>While testing get_bs(
		store, pages), please don't make the <i>pages</i> parameter take
		values greater than 100 (theoriotically, it can be 128). This might cause unnecessary congestion in
		the page server resulting in its crash (which happens often
		nonetheless). We won't test your code with values bigger than 100.
	<p>
		<b>11) How do I test replacement policies?</b>
	<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a constant called
		NFRAMES in paging.h which has a value of 1024. Make sure that your
		entire code depends on this constant as a measure of the available
		free frames. If we change the constant's value to
		say 400, then the number of free frames initially available is only
		400, i.e., your main memory looks as if it has only 1024+NFRAMES =
		1024+400 = 1424 frames of memory. So, you have ample scope to test
		your replacement policy by changing the NFRAMES constant. <br>&nbsp;
		<br>
                <b>12) What order to allocate a free frame if there are more than 2 free frames?</b>
        <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always allocate a lower frame first. For example,
if both frame 1045 and 1050 are free, allocate frame 1045 first.
