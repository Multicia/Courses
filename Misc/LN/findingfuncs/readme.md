==========

- The tfidf list doesn't seem to be working. 
TODO:
1. write a regular expression which would just choose the functions rather than the words (Most of the words in the list doesn't seem to be right)
2. 

- Removed stemming and remove ". " rather than "."

- Graphs are being generated along with the weights.
