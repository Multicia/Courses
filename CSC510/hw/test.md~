Productivity Report
======
Productivity report for Vivek Nair.

1. Installation
------------
I installed RescueTime on Wednesday(Aug 22). This involved installing a browser plugin and a .deb file.

2. Report
------
**Wednesday:** 
I was at my lab the whole day and working on the lab machine. This is clearly seen in the report where I am just active for a period of 2 hours. The screenshot is as seen below. ![alt-text](wednesday.png)

The most of the time I am answering emails at the end of the day and checking facebook etc.

**Thursday:**
Again I was at the lab today and had a couple of classes to attend. We can observe the same trend as the wednesday since I was at the class most of the time and not carry about my laptop.

**Friday**
I was at home today and most of the time I was working on my assignment which is evident from the fact that I have been using vim and visiting stackoverflow for most of the time.

3. Conclusion
-------------

I would ideally want to put in more time in development and have spend less time on social networking sites. I would be ideally following my productivity while tweaking my habits.
